# Managing Machine Learning Workflow Components
Machine Learning Workflows (MLWfs) have become essential and a disruptive approach in problem-solving over several industries. However, the development process of MLWfs may be complicated, hard to achieve, time-consuming, and error-prone. To handle this problem, in this paper, we introduce machine learning workflow management (MLWfM) as a technique to aid the development and reuse of MLWfs and their components through three aspects: representation, execution, and creation. More precisely, we discuss our approach to structure the MLWfs' components and their metadata to aid retrieval and reuse of components in new MLWfs. Also, we consider the execution of these components within a tool. The hybrid knowledge representation, called Hyperknowledge, frames our methodology, supporting the three MLWfM's aspects. To validate our approach, we show a practical use case in the Oil & Gas industry.
